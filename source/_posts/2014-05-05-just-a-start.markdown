As an engineer, I certainly can code without any help but not always come up with best solutions. 
In the meantime, how you call for a help becomes a must for every engineer. 

Remember that when I got stuck in errors of the program I was working on, I always google or visit tech forums to look for answers.
Sometimes there is a better solution that fits your need. Then say we are lucky. However, if there is no solution but
something very close to what you want, you probably have to revise the code on top of it to complete your task. 
Or even worse you have to write codes from scratch. For engineers including me, this process seems an infinite loop in our daily life.

As blogging technologies advance, many of engineers share their experiences like problems you solved, opinions about tech trends, knowledge of 
techniques, etc, which becomes anthoer option for those who have problems with their work or want to learn more from experienced ones.
Being in the engineering world, I have benefited much from all of these resources, making me think of one day I will be one of them to help others
on the same path. And now it is my beginning.
